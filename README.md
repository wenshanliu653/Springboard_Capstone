This project aimed to analyze coffee reviews from a structured dataset and predict the overall coffee rating based on sensory attributes (aroma, acidity, body, flavor, aftertaste) and categorical features (origin, processing method, roasting level). 
The goal was to identify key factors influencing coffee quality and provide predictive insights for coffee producers and consumers.
